    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>In 1817 Baron Karl von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster. It had two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
    <p class="example">The machine became known as the Draisine (English) or more commonly the hobby horse. It was made entirely of wood and metal. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
    <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1863, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede ("fast foot"), but was commonly known as the boneshaker, since it was also made entirely of wood and metal, then later with metal tires, and the combination of these with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad, and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
